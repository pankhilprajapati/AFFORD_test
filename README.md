Q1. Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists within the grid. The word can be constructed
from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically
neighbouring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once. 

- board and word consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters
- 1 <= board.length <= 200
- 1 <= board[i].length <= 200
- 1 <= word.length <= 10^3 


Solution : prob1.cpp
